# Thermal Bluetooth Printer Library

A lightweight JavaScript library that enables web applications to connect to a Bluetooth thermal printer using the Web Bluetooth API and send print commands. This library is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/escpos-printer-bt) and is built with modularity in mind by separating Bluetooth connection from printing logic.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Two separate classes for managing Bluetooth connections and printing commands.
- **Method Chaining:** Chain printing commands for formatting text (e.g., align center, add text, cut, and print).
- **Easy Integration:** Install via npm and import into your projects.
- **Browser Support:** Works in modern browsers supporting the Web Bluetooth API.
